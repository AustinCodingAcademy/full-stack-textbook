### "Spec"ing out the MVP
All great apps start out as an idea. That idea is broken down into smaller, more detailed, ideas, called "specs", or specifications. The ideas are expanded, prioritized, and cut until you have the map to your MVP (Minimum Viable Product). This is the level your app needs to reach before you, an investor, or a small level of test users decide of your app has potential or if it's worth spending any more of your precious time on.
